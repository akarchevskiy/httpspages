The United States Navy and Marine Corps have a
long and successful history of creating world-class
educational institutions to prepare their forces
for all aspects of naval warfare. The United States
Naval Academy, the Naval War College, the Naval
Postgraduate School, Marine Corps University, and
the Naval ROTC programs have produced some of
our nation’s finest leaders in war and peace. We are
proud of this legacy, which provides an outstanding
foundation as we move towards the future. We must,
however, continually seek to improve our approach to
education to ensure our competitive advantage.
In recent years, Defense and Naval Leaders have
repeatedly called for a renewed emphasis on
professional military education as a foundation
of national security. The 2018 National Defense
Strategy observed that “the creativity and talent of
the American warfighter is our greatest enduring
strength,” but warned that our professional military
education system had “stagnated.” The following
year, the landmark Education for Seapower (E4S)
report concluded that to maintain naval power in an
era of great power competition and technological
change, the Navy and Marine Corps need to
strengthen and expand their educational efforts.
In line with these conclusions, the Commandant’s
Planning Guidance, the Chief of Naval Operations’
Fragmentary Order, and the Department of the
Navy’s Human Capital Strategy all recognize the need
for changes in the prioritization, integration, and
resourcing of naval education.
